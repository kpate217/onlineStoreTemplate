# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Revisions

When a change is made to the document, a new revision should be created. The revision should be added to the table below with all information filled out.

## Introduction

In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section.

## Requirements

- **REQ-10** 
    - **Description:** The system will track and decide to add a free cookie for a customer if it's their first order.
    - **Type:** Functional
    - **Priority:** 3
    - **Rationale:** This requirement is helpful to encourage people to make their first order and retain them as customers.
    - **Testing:** Test cases can be used to check if the function classifies them as first customer or not based on customer information.

  - **REQ-11** 
    - **Description:** The system will add employee information to an employee list. 
    - **Type:** Functional
    - **Priority:** 3
    - **Rationale:** This requirement is helpful to track all the employees in the restaurant.
    - **Testing:** Test cases can be used to check if the function classifies them as first customer or not based on customer information.

  - **REQ-12** 
    - **Description:** The system will allow employees to clock-in and clock-out their work hours
    - **Type:** Functional
    - **Priority:** 3
    - **Rationale:** This requirement servers to help manage the employees in the restaurant.
    - **Testing:** Test cases can be used to check if the function can track the duration of each employee's work hours based on the time elapsed between them clocking in and clocking out.

## Constraints

- **Constraint-7:**  The project needs to be complete enough to offer valuable support to restaurants 
  - **Description:** This project needs to fulfill the expectations of stakeholders with a comprehensive system that can add/track orders, employees, and manage inventory.   

- **Constraint-8:**  The project needs to be functional with little-to-no risk of failure in the functioning of the menu system
 - **Description:** There is potential for failure and risk of errors in the project functions. The project needs to be carefully tested for bugs with a variety of test-cases in order to avoid losses for the restaurant.

## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

- **U-7:** 
  - **Description:** An employee clock-in/clock-out their work hours.
  - **Actors:** Employee
  - **Preconditions:** The employee needs to click the clock button and enter their employee ID before pressing either clock-in/clock-out.   
  - **Postconditions:** If the employee clocked-in, they need to ensure they clock back out after their work is done. This action will be tracked and added to the work hours database.

  - **U-8:** 
  - **Description:** An employee checks and modifies inventory information based on the amounts needed. 
  - **Actors:** Employee
  - **Preconditions:** The employee needs to log in to the menu system and click the inventory option. They will then check and edit the numbers for each items based on the items that are newly stocked up. 
  - **Postconditions:** The changes will be saved in the inventory database and will display inventory insights such as an estimate on when to stock up on items again.

## User Stories


- **US-7:** 
  - **Type of User:** Employee
  - **Description:** As an employee, I would want to log my work hours and ensure that my contribution to the restaurant is tracked.

  - **US-8:** 
  - **Type of User:** Manager
  - **Description:** As the manager, I will need to track our restaurant inventory in order to stock up on time and ensure there is a pefect supply of items that don't sit in the inventory for too long, especially when they have a low shelf life.

## Glossary


- **Term:** Clock-in
  - **Definition:** To start recording the time an employee had started their work in the kitchen. This serves to track their performance and are paid based on their work hours.

  - **Term:** Clock-out
  - **Definition:** To stop recording the time when an employee finishes their workshift in the kitchen. This serves to ensure the timer does not go on indefinitely.




Try to only list terms that a naive user would not understand.
