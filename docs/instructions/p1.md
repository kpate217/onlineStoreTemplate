# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section.

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like REQ-1, REQ-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Description:** A short description of the requirement. This should be a single sentence that describes the requirement. Do not replace the word `Description` with the actual description. Put the description in the space where these instructions are written. Maintain that practice for all future sections.
  - **Type:** The type of requirement. Should be either `Functional` or `Non-Functional`.
  - **Priority:** The priority of the requirement. This should be a number between 1 and 5, with 1 being the highest priority and 5 being the lowest priority.
  - **Rationale:** A short description of why the requirement is important. This should be a single sentence that describes why the requirement is important.
  - **Testing:** A short description of how the requirement can be tested. This should be a single sentence that describes how the requirement can be tested.
- **ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like REQ-1, REQ-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Description:** A short description of the requirement. This should be a single sentence that describes the requirement.

  - **Description:** The menu system should display detailed information about each menu item, including ingredients, allergens, and nutritional information.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 2
  - **Rationale:** This requirement is crucial because it gives customers the information they need to make decisions about the menu items based on their dietary preferences, restrictions, or allergies. Additionally, it encourages openness and customer confidence.
  - **Testing:** The capacity of the menu system to show accurate and thorough information for each menu item, including components, allergens, and nutritional information, can be used to assess the criterion.
- **REQ-3:**
  - **Description:** The menu system should support customization of menu items, allowing customers to make modifications or special requests.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 3
  - **Rationale:** This need is crucial since it allows for the customization of the dining experience by taking into account the tastes and dietary requirements of the patrons. Additionally, it enables the restaurant to accommodate certain demands, increasing client pleasure and loyalty.
  - **Testing:** By confirming that the menu system enables consumers to make adjustments or special requests for menu items and making sure that the desired changes are properly conveyed to the kitchen staff or included in the final order, the requirement may be tested.


## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.

- **Constraint-1:** The system will be compatible with Google Chrome Web Browser
  - **Description:** Allows customers to accesss the system with multiple devices supporting chrome web browsers
- **Constraint-2:** The development of the restaurant menu system must be finished in a predefined timeline
  - **Description:** Ensures efficient management in completing the project


- **Constraint-1:**  The project has a limited budget allocated for its development and implementation.
  - **Description:** The budget constraint may limit the available resources for the project, affecting the scope of development, the number of features that can be implemented, and the overall quality of the restaurant menu system. It may require careful prioritization and cost-effective solutions to meet project goals within the allocated budget.
- **Constraint-2:** The project has a strict deadline for completion and deployment of the restaurant menu system.
  - **Description:** The time constraint imposes a sense of urgency and requires efficient project management to ensure timely delivery. It may affect the level of functionality, testing, and refinement that can be incorporated into the system. Meeting the deadline may require effective time allocation, clear task prioritization, and agile development practices to streamline the project timeline and meet stakeholder expectations.

## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the use case. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like UC-1, UC-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Description:** A description of the use case that gives the user a high-level overview of how the system is interacted with.
  - **Actors:** A list of the actors that are involved in the use case. Only include the actors that are directly involved. Actors are the people or things that interact with the system. For example, when ordering at a fast food restaurant, one might have the following actors: the customer, the cashier, and the cook. But only the customer and the cashier are directly involved in the use case of ordering food. The cook is not directly involved in the use case of ordering food.
  - **Preconditions:** A list of the preconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the preconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met before the use case can be executed. Continuing with the restaurant example, the customer must have money in their wallet and the cashier must be logged in to the system before the use case of ordering food can be executed.
  - **Postconditions:** A list of the postconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the postconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met after the use case has been executed. Continuing with the restaurant example, the customer must have their food and the cashier must have the customer's money after the use case of ordering food has been executed.

- **UC-1:**
  - **Description:** A customer searches for a menu item
  - **Actors:** Customer
  - **Preconditions:** The customer selected their menu items
  - **Postconditions:** The order is confirmed and the order is sent to restaurant staff

  - **Actors:** Manager, Kitchen Staff
  - **Preconditions:**  The manager must be logged in to the menu system with appropriate access privileges. The menu item to be modified must exist in the system.
  - **Postconditions:** The specified menu item is successfully modified and the changes are reflected in the system. The updated version of the menu item is available for ordering.

## User Stories

In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the user story. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like US-1, US-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Type of User:** The type of user that the user story is for. This should be a single word that describes the type of user. For example, a user story for a customer might be `Customer` and a user story for an administrator might be `Admin`.
  - **Description:** A description of the user story that gives a narrative from that user's perspective. This can be any length, but it must paint the picture of what the user wants to do, how they intend to do it, why they want to, and what they expect to happen.

  - **Description:** In order to identify options that satisfy my dietary needs, I want to be able to filter menu items depending on dietary preferences, such as vegetarian or gluten-free. I anticipate the menu system to show me only the menu items that meet the filters I've chosen, letting me make decisions without having to comb through unnecessary alternatives.
- **US-2:**
  - **Type of User:** Manager
  - **Description:** In order to examine the performance of various menu items, identify popular selections, and make data-driven decisions to optimize the menu and maximize profitability, I as a manager need to be able to view sales figures and analytics produced by the menu system. I anticipate that the menu system will offer thorough and aesthetically pleasing reports that are simple to export or distribute to stakeholders.
