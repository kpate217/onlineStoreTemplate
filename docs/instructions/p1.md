# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section.

Project Overview:
Our project aims to provide a comprehensive menu system for restaurants that improve operational effectiveness and patrons' eating experience. Customers will have access to a simple user interface that allows them to browse, search, and modify menu items. Additionally, it will facilitate communication between consumers, culinary staff, and management and assist online ordering.

Problem Statement:
The restaurant's present manual menu system has drawbacks and inefficiency. Customers frequently have difficulties discovering particular items on a physical menu, navigating through it, or obtaining specific information like ingredients, allergens, and nutritional values. Additionally, taking and managing orders can be labor-intensive and error-prone, which has an impact on both client happiness and operational effectiveness.

Stakeholders and their Needs:
Customers:
-They want a user-friendly, digital menu system that makes browsing, searching, and personalizing menu items simple.
-Require access to specific menu item details, including ingredients, allergies, and nutritional information.
-For a flawless eating experience, look for a convenient and effective online ordering system.
Kitchen Staff: 
-To prepare and complete customer orders, precise and accurate order details are required.
-To properly handle unique requests or revisions from clients, a simplified communication channel is necessary.
Managers/Restaurant Owners:
-To quickly update and maintain the menu, look for a centralized system.
-To make data-driven decisions for menu upgrades and inventory management, you need insights and analytics.

Our software system strives to improve customer satisfaction, order accuracy, streamline processes, and offer helpful management insights by meeting these needs.
